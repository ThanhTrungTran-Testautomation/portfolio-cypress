Portfolio-cypress
This repository demonstrates a **pragmatic and maintainable approach to web test automation** using **Cypress**.

## Overview
The focus is **not** on covering everything, but on:
- stability
- readability
- maintainability
- realistic test strategy

It reflects how I design test automation in real-world projects as a **Senior QA Engineer **.

## Goals of this Project
- Showcase clean and stable Cypress-based E2E tests
- Demonstrate a maintainable test structure
- Avoid flaky tests by design
- Show how UI tests fit into a realistic QA strategy
- Provide CI-ready test execution

## Tech Stack
- **Cypress**
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Node.js
- (Optional) CI/CD: GitHub Actions / GitLab CI

---

## Test Scope & Strategy

### What is covered
- Critical user flows (e.g. login, core business paths)
- Happy paths and selected negative cases
- UI tests focused on business value

### What is intentionally NOT covered
- Every UI detail
- Purely technical edge cases better suited for unit tests
- Unstable flows with no business relevance

> The goal is **confidence**, not maximum test count.
